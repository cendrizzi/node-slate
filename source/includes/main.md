# Introduction

Welcome to the MTP API documentation. This portion of our API is intended to help application developers. If you aren't an application developer then this section probably isn't for you.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

## Ways To Consume Our Data
There are two different ways to consume data using the MTP Service, Real Time or Replications. Both approaches use the same API but differ in how they can be used.

### Real Time (use us as your database)
When using real time data. Your application uses the MTP API as it's backend data layer. For example if you have a mobile app that shows pins for different properies over a map, then each time you run a query you will perform an HTTP request directly to the MTP API.

<aside class="notice">
Real time queries are limited to 50 results returned at once, additional results can be reached using pagination
</aside>

### Replication (use your own database)
Replication is intended for application that use their own database backend and simple want a copy of the data hosted on MTP.

<aside class="notice">
Replication queries are limited in searcha capability but allow up to 500 results returned at once, additional results can be reached using pagination
</aside>

# Technology Overview
Before diving into the details of how to use our API, it's worth understanding what our technology our API uses. RESO is a standards organization that has standardized real estate data and how to get this data. MTP is built on top of this standardization effort.

## RESO Data Dictionary
The reso data dictionary is a multi-year effort that has lead to the standardization of fields used to describe residential property data. Listing data provided by MTP uses this schema.

## RESO WEB API
The RESO WEB API standard is a restful API that allows developers to query and consume listing data. It in turn is built on top of another standard: ODATA. ODATA is a standard that was started by Microsoft that goes beyond a simple restful service and also defines a query language that can be used to essentially allow SQL like queries over HTTP.






# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```bash
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```bash
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```

This endpoint retrieves all kittens.

### HTTP Request

`GET http://example.com/api/kittens`

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
include_cats | false | If set to true, the result will also include cats.
available | true | If set to false, the result will include kittens that have already been adopted.

<aside class="success">
Remember â€” a happy kitten is an authenticated kitten!
</aside>

## Get a Specific Kitten

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get(2)
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get(2)
```

```bash
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens/2"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let max = api.kittens.get(2);
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Max",
  "breed": "unknown",
  "fluffiness": 5,
  "cuteness": 10
}
```

This endpoint retrieves a specific kitten.

### HTTP Request

`GET http://example.com/kittens/<ID>`

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
ID | The ID of the kitten to retrieve
